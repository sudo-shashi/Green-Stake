## Improvement Summary
| Feedback | Improvement Made | Commit Link |
|---|---|---|
| Submit button lacked clear animated loading state. | Added pulse animation while submission is in progress. | [312eba6](https://github.com/sudo-shashi/Green-Stake/commit/312eba6) |
| Inputs did not have a prominent focus ring. | Added stronger focus ring styles to key form fields. | [3c32a2d](https://github.com/sudo-shashi/Green-Stake/commit/3c32a2d) |
| Nav hover felt static. | Increased hover contrast and scale feedback. | [6917b4c](https://github.com/sudo-shashi/Green-Stake/commit/6917b4c) |
| Claim cards needed more visual lift. | Added stronger shadow and hover translation. | [9433078](https://github.com/sudo-shashi/Green-Stake/commit/9433078) |
| Pending badge blended in too much. | Made pending state brighter and easier to scan. | [7e2b6c6](https://github.com/sudo-shashi/Green-Stake/commit/7e2b6c6) |
| Dashboard empty state was confusing. | Added filter guidance to empty-state copy. | [ad734f1](https://github.com/sudo-shashi/Green-Stake/commit/ad734f1) |
| Statistical numbers were too small. | Increased counter size and weight. | [082d936](https://github.com/sudo-shashi/Green-Stake/commit/082d936) |
| Hero text was hard to read. | Added stronger text shadow for contrast. | [7ce7e8d](https://github.com/sudo-shashi/Green-Stake/commit/7ce7e8d) |
| Footer needed separation. | Added top margin and subtle shadow. | [e01d78d](https://github.com/sudo-shashi/Green-Stake/commit/e01d78d) |
| Tree growth visualizer felt static. | Added continuous pulse to canopy rings. | [8f8566c](https://github.com/sudo-shashi/Green-Stake/commit/8f8566c) |

## Contract Flow
1. Planter uploads photo proof.
2. App stores the photo as `ipfs://CID`.
3. Wallet signs `submit_claim`.
4. API route broadcasts signed transaction to testnet.
5. Verifiers vote on pending claim.
6. Two approvals pay stake plus fixed reward.
7. Two rejections or expiry refund stake and release indexes.

## Local Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Checks
```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
```

### Contract Build
```bash
npm run contract:build
```

## Environment Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_GATEWAY`
- `PINATA_JWT`
- `PINATA_GATEWAY`
- `ADMIN_ADDRESS`

## CI
- Frontend job now runs install, typecheck, lint, test, and build.
- Contract job now runs `cargo fmt --check` and WASM build.

## Notes
- `contract/deploy.sh` deploys and initializes contract on Stellar testnet.
- Current frontend submit flow signs in wallet, then broadcasts through `/api/submit-claim`.
- Dashboard reads live claims from deployed contract, not local stubs.

## Local Setup
### Frontend
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Frontend Checks
```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
```

### Contract Build
```bash
npm run contract:build
